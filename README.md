# green_heaven_online_market
This is my fourth milestone project with Code Institute and Runshaw College. I used Django for this project.
# 1. Purpose of the project
The aim of this project is to develop an online garden center for an imaginary company, enabling them to effectively sell gardening products, plants, and seeds. This platform will enhance their marketing reach, providing a convenient 24/7 online presence and allowing customers to browse and shop from the comfort of their homes. The project seeks to streamline the shopping experience by offering easy navigation, personalized account features, and seamless checkout. Additionally, it will empower customers to discover new products, while helping the company attract a broader audience and increase sales.
